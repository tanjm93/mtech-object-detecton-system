# Introduction
The **Object Detection System** is an application designed and developed by a group of 4 - Zhou Zhibiao, Sureshkumar Sujatha, Tan Jun Ming and Lim Zhi Jing - during our Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligence Systems Programme in NUS-ISS. 

The objective of this development is to develop an object detection application to assist in building a robotic disassembly system. Specifically, our developed system is designed to process the image taken by the camera mounted on an industry six-axis robot arm and identify all the bolts to be removed. Thereafter, our system will provide the boltsâ€™ physical coordinates to the robot for automated unbolting.

As a proof-of-concept, a UI has been designed for user to upload an image to be processed. Bolts in the images will be identified along with the coordinates tabulated.

The overall architecture for the application is as depicted in the figure above. The key components and techniques used in the developments include:
1. Image Distortion Correction
2. Object Recognition (fine-tuned Yolo v8 base)
3. Object Edge Detection (fine-tuned Yolo segmentation)

# Setting up of the application


## 1. Setting up virtual environment

- Set up a new virtual environment with the python version `python = 3.11.9`
- Install the required libraries from requirements.txt
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    

## 2. Download of source code from github

- Download the code from this github repo.
        

## 3. Start the application

- Navigate to the repo folder in which the [app.py](http://app.py) is located. Run the following commands.
    - For *Windows*
        
        ```bash
        set FLASK_APP=app
        set FLASK_DEBUG=1
        flask run
        ```
        
    - For *Linux*
        
        ```bash
        export FLASK_APP=app
        export FLASK_DEBUG=1
        flask run
        ```
        
- The application will be running on localhost `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 4. Testing of UI

- Some testing images are saved in the folder .\test_images. Feel free to test them out or try with your own images.
